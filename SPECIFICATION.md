## 1. Scanning and Storage Architecture

### Scan Process Design
- Select a directory for processing
- Perform a single, comprehensive scan of the entire directory
- Generate a persistent duplicate detection report
- Decouple scanning from user interaction
- Store potential duplicates in a structured, queryable format

### Data Storage Model
```json
{
  "scan_metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2024-08-14T10:30:00Z",
    "total_files_scanned": 40000,
    "potential_duplicate_groups": 1500
  },
  "duplicate_groups": [
    {
      "group_id": "unique_group_identifier",
      "files": [
        {
          "path": "/full/path/to/file1.jpg",
          "filename": "file1.jpg",
          "size": 1024000,
          "modified_date": "2023-01-15T14:30:00Z",
          "proposed_action": null
        },
        {
          "path": "/full/path/to/file2.jpg",
          "filename": "file2.jpg",
          "size": 512000,
          "modified_date": "2023-01-15T14:30:00Z",
          "proposed_action": null
        }
      ],
      "detection_method": "filename_pattern"
    }
  ],
  "user_decisions": {
    "group_id": {
      "keep": "/path/to/kept/file",
      "delete": ["/path/to/deleted/file1", "/path/to/deleted/file2"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 2. Efficient Scanning Strategy

### Key Performance Optimizations
- Single-pass directory traversal
- Minimal memory footprint
- Persistent storage of scan results
- Asynchronous processing
- Resumable scanning for large directories

## 3. User Interaction Workflow

### Scanning and Review Process
1. **Initial Scan**
   - Comprehensive directory scan
   - Generate potential duplicate groups
   - Store results in persistent storage

2. **User Review Stage**
   - Load pre-scanned duplicate groups
   - Allow user to review each group
   - Mark actions for each file (keep/delete)
   - No immediate file modifications

3. **Execution Stage**
   - After complete review
   - Execute all user-confirmed actions
   - Batch file operations
   - Logging of all actions


## 4. Additional Efficiency Features

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal I/O during scanning
- Lazy loading of file previews
- Async user interface
- Cancelable long-running tasks

### Storage Optimizations
- Compact storage format
- Incremental updates
- Option to prune old scan results

## 5. Error Handling and Safety

### Safeguards
- No automatic deletions
- Confirmation required for all actions
- Comprehensive logging

### Logging
- Detailed scan logs
- User decision tracking
- Error and exception logging

## 6. Implementation Recommendations

### Technology Options
- Choose lightweight efficient tech stack

## 7. Running the application
- I want this app to run easily
- Include instructions to run 
- Assume that users will download the application from git hub so set up relevant gitignore file
